Revisiting the Flaring Activity in Early 2015 of BL Lacertae Object S5 0716+714
</a>
<p>
Ouyang et. al. 2025 <br>

In this work, we analyzed multiwavelength data of the BL Lac object S5 0716+714 to investigate its emission mechanisms during a flaring state observed in early 2015. 
We examined the temporal behavior and broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) during the flare. 
The size of the $\gamma$-ray emission region was estimated based on the variability timescale. 
To explore the multiwavelength properties of S5 0716+714, we employed three one-zone models: the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model, 
the SSC plus external Compton (EC) model, and the SSC plus $pp$ interactions model, to reproduce the SEDs. 
Our findings indicate that, while the SSC model can describe the SEDs, it requires an extreme Doppler factor. 
In contrast, the SSC plus EC model successfully fits the SEDs under the assumption of weak external photon fields but requires a high Doppler factor. 
Additionally, the SSC plus $pp$ interactions model also reproduces the SEDs, with $\gamma$-ray emission originating from $\pi^{0}$ decay. 
However, this model leads to a jet power that exceeds the Eddington luminosity, which remains plausible due to the flaring state or the presence of a highly collimated jet.

Changing-Look Behavior and Amplitude-Modulated QPO in Blazar Ton 599
</a>
<p>
Chen et. al. 2025 <br>

Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are powered by supermassive black holes and exhibit different observational types, primarily 
due to orientation effects according to the uniﬁed model of AGN. Changing-look AGNs (CL AGNs), however, challenge this 
paradigm by transitioning between different types over time. A hallmark of CL AGNs is the variability of the broad emission line 
(BEL) ﬂux relative to the continuum. In this study, we investigate the optical spectral evolution of Ton 599 and its correlation 
with the γ -ray ﬂux in the GeV band. The optical continuum ﬂux density exhibits strong variability, with a normalized excess 
variance of Fvar = 1 . 089. In contrast, the MgII ﬂux varies with a much smaller amplitude ( Fvar = 0 . 194), while the equivalent 
width of Mg II shows intermediate variability ( Fvar = 0 . 686). A strong correlation is observed between the optical continuum 
and the γ -ray ﬂux, suggesting a common origin. In addition, an amplitude-modulated quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a 
period of ∼176 d is identiﬁed in the γ -ray light curve during MJD 57000–58400, with modulation on a ∼400-d time-scale. A 
similar QPO with a period of ∼181 d is also detected in the optical g-band light curve during MJD 59500–60100. The presence 
of these QPOs in both bands likely reﬂect the inﬂuence of geometrical structures in the jet as well as long-term bursts. Our 
results suggest that jet dynamics may drive CL events in some AGNs, contributing to our understanding of the physical processes 
governing AGN jets and offering critical reﬁnements to the uniﬁed model.

Optical Monitoring and Spectral Analysis of OJ 287
</a>
<p>
Yuan et. al. 2025 <br>

We present a comprehensive multiband optical monitoring and spectral analysis of the blazar OJ 287, conducted
using the 1.26 m National Astronomical Observatory–Guangzhou University Infrared/Optical telescope (NGT).
During an intensive 17 day observational campaign from 2022 December to 2023 January, we obtained 2716
high-quality photometric observations (929 in the g band, 887 in the r band, and 900 in the i band). The data
reveal signiffcant variability across all bands. Our main ffndings are as follows. (1) Signiffcant magnitude
variations were detected: Δmg = 0.945 ± 0.048 mag (g band), Δmr = 0.648 ± 0.023 mag (r band), and
Δmi = 0.945 ± 0.051 mag (i band). (2) Numerous intraday variability (IDV) events were identiffed, with
characteristic parameters (Δm, ΔT, and VR = m
T ) showing consistent patterns between the g and r bands but
distinct behavior in the i band. (3) Successful modeling of intraday light curves using a multi-Gaussian function,
yielding brightening ( Tb) and dimming ( Td) timescales, and revealing an average peak separation of
ΔTc = 42.96 ± 0.99 minutes that appears to be frequency independent. (4) Development of a novel radiation
framework suggesting that the observed IDV phenomena originate from multiple components—with the
frequency-independent variations attributable to the central black hole, while frequency-dependent variations
stem from jet and accretion disk processes.

The Multi-band Luminosity CorrelationAnalysis for the Fermi Blazars
</a>
<p>
Ou et. al. 2025 <br>

Multi-band and γ -ray radiation are important properties of blazars. In this paper, the luminosity correlations between the γ -ray and lower-energy 
( radio, optical, and X-ray) bands for both the observed and intrinsic data are investigated using the multiple linear regression analysis for a sample 
of 642 blazars ( 227 ffat spectrum radio quasars and 415 BL Lacertae objects) . In addition, we employ a partial correlation analysis to exclude the 
redshift effect in the mutual correlation analysis. We also investigate the intrinsic luminosity correlations using the second-order partial correlation 
analysis to exclude the effects of redshift and Doppler factor, which has allowed us to obtain the intrinsic correlation without the inffuence of 
relativistic beaming effect or redshift. We ffnd that both the observed and intrinsic γ -ray emissions are correlated with the radio, optical, and 
the X-ray bands, with the radio and optical bands being important for the γ -ray emissions, indicating that the γ -ray emissions originate from the 
lepton model, including self-synchrotron Compton and external Compton processes.

Accretion properties and jet mechanisms for the low-excitation radio galaxies

</a>
<p>
Ye et. al. 2025 <br>

Context. Radio galaxies(RGs) are a subclass of active galactic nuclei, which are suggested to be the parent populations of blazars.Based
on morphologies and radio powers, RGs can be classiﬁed as Fanaroﬀ-Riley type 0 (FR 0s), I (FR Is), and II (FR IIs) RGs. According
to the accretion-ejection paragram, RGs can be classiﬁed as low-excitation or high-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs or HERGs).
Aims. We aim to compile a distance-limited (z < 0.15) sample of 431 LERGs (FR 0s, FR Is, and FR IIs) in order to discuss their
jet-formation mechanism with the advection-dominated accretion-ﬂow (ADAF) scenario, and compare their accretion properties with
Fermi BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs).
Methods. We explored diﬀerent jet mechanisms (Blandford-Znajek [BZ] model and a mixture of the BZ and Blandford-Payne hybrid
model) within the framework of ADAF-type disc around a Kerr black hole for both LERGs and Fermi BL Lacs.
Results. Based on standard assumptions on the accretion-ejection coupling in RGs, the maximum kinetic jet and accretion power
for FR 0s, FR Is, and FR IIs can be explained by an ADAF with the pure BZ mechanism or hybrid jet mechanism. In addition,
for one-third of the FR IIs, to account for their kinetic jet power that is higher than what is expected of the hybrid jet mechanism,
the magnetic ﬁeld could play an important role, for example as in the form of magnetisation-driven outﬂows or stronger magnetic
structures observed in some BL Lacs with high jet powers.
Conlcusions. Similarities between BL Lacs and LERGs (e.g. accretion-ejection and clustering properties) suggest that highsynchrotron-peaked
 BL Lacs could be the beamed counterparts of FR 0s, and a potential general uniﬁcation between LERGs and
BL Lacs populations is discussed. However, a complete sample of BL Lacs is needed to robustly compare the jet and accretion
properties with those of LERGs in the future.

Beaming Effect in TeV Blazars

</a>
<p>
Qian et. al. 2025 <br>

The detection of TeV emission in extragalactic galaxies has prompted investigations into the beaming effect in
blazars, a key feature of relativistic jets modulating multiwavelength radiation, yet quantitative constraints remain
limited. This study aims to systematically analyze the beaming effect in TeV blazars by disentangling the beamed
and unbeamed components of high-energy spectra and estimating Doppler factors across X-ray, γ-ray, and TeV
bands. We also probe the de-beamed (intrinsic) luminosities in these high-energy bands. A comprehensive sample
of 51 TeV blazars is compiled. A two-component model is applied to decompose core-dominated and extended
emissions, and Doppler factors are derived from the core-dominance parameters and the jet geometries. Lowsynchrotron-peaked
 sources exhibit the strongest beaming, conffrming that high-energy core-dominance
parameters serve as robust tracers of the beaming effect. Doppler factors are highest in the γ-ray band and
show a concave-to-convex evolution from radio to TeV bands, suggesting distinct emission regions or viewing
angles. Derived Doppler factors enable the calculation of de-beamed intrinsic luminosities, offering insights into
the blazar jet’s intrinsic properties.
